#  CNN Style Transfer Model
Two high-resolution images are used in this lab. One image is used as the base image and
another one is used as the style image. The base image has a shape of (1200, 1920, 3) and
the style image has a shape of (934, 1160, 3). This aim is to perform an image fusion using
the content information of the base image and the texture information of the style image.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the TensorFlow and Keras teams for providing the tools to build and train the Conditional GAN model. I would also like to thank the authors of the paper “Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets” for providing the theoretical background for this project.

## Demo

- Breadth-First Search (FIFO): The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
- Depth-First Search (LIFO): The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
- Uniform-Cost Search: The route is [1, 3, 6, 5], and total cost is 20.

## Lessons Learned
- Scale data to a uniform size, convert the images from RGB to BGR format, and subtract
the means of three channels in ImageNet, respectively. 
- Define the model loss which contains a style loss and a content loss. 
- Load the VGG19 model using keras package
- Construct the network using the VGG19 model and construct the total loss function.
- Train the constructed model with thousands of epochs, and save the generated image
every 10 epochs.
- Observe/visualise the generated images.
